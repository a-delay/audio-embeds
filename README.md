# smaller_audio_embeds for xkit

A cool third-party extension for New XKit on Tumblr that turns big SoundCloud and Spotify embeds into the smaller embed versions. The smaller ones look more like Tumblr's native audio player, which makes for a far more aesthetically coherent experience on your dash.

## installation

Step 0: Download New XKit if you don't already have it

Step 1: Navigate to XKit's editor. XKIT > Other > Advanced Settings: XKit Editor > Open Editor

Step 2: Create a new extension and name it 'smaller_audio_embeds' (without the single quotes) <br><strong>Naming it smaller_audio_embeds is important, don't name it something else</strong>

Step 3: Delete everything in the editor (don't worry we'll put it all back)

Step 4: Copy+paste everything in <a href="https://github.com/a-delay/audio-embeds/blob/master/smaller_audio_embeds.js">smaller_audio_embeds.js</a> into the editor

Step 5: Save and go back to Tumblr and marvel at how much space you're saving
