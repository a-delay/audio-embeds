# xkit-soundcloud-player

A cool third-party extension for XKit on Tumblr that turns big SoundCloud embeds into the smaller embed versions. <br>
The smaller ones look more like Tumblr's native audio player, which makes for a far more aesthetically coherent experience on your dash.

## installation

Step 1: Download XKit

Step 2: Navigate to XKit's editor. XKIT > Other > Advanced Settings: XKit Editor > Open Editor

Step 3: Create a new extension and name it 'soundcloud_player' (without the single quotes)

Step 4: Delete everything in the editor (don't worry we'll put it all back)

Step 4: Copy+paste everything in <a href="">soundcloud_player.js</a> into the editor

Step 5: Save and go back to Tumblr
